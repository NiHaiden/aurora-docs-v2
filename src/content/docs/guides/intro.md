## Aurora

A familiar KDE desktop for people who love Fedora Kinoite. Aurora is a maintenance-free, reliable and fast operating system for everyone, stable like a Chromebook. It combines the power of Fedora and the beauty of a KDE desktop in a single, reliable and sleek package.

- Developers, check out [Aurora-DX](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/bluefin-dx) for developer focused images! 

> "The desire to reach for the stars is ambitious. The desire to reach hearts is wise." - Maya Angelou

## Features

**This image heavily utilizes _cloud-native concepts_.**

System updates are image-based and automatic. Applications are logically separated from the system by using Flatpaks for graphical applications and `brew` for command line applications. Workloads for development are containerized. 

## For Users

- [Ptyxis terminal](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=300) for container-focused workflows
  - [Boxbuddy](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.dvlv.boxbuddyrs) for container management
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) - included for VPN along with `wireguard-tools`
- KDE Discover with [Flathub](https://flathub.org):
  - Use a familiar software center UI to install graphical software
  - [Warehouse](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.flattool.Warehouse) included for flatpak management
- Quality of Life Features
  - [Starship](https://starship.rs) terminal prompt enabled by default
  - Docker & Podman Developer Edition Images contain both Docker and Podman runtimes to support your containerized needs.
  - [Input Leap](https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap) built in
  - [Solaar](https://github.com/pwr-Solaar/Solaar) - included for Logitech mouse 
management along with `libratbagd`
  - [rclone](https://rclone.org/) and [restic](https://restic.net/) included
  - `zsh` and `fish` included (optional) 
- Built on top of the the [Universal Blue main image](https://github.com/ublue-os/main)
  - Extra udev rules for game controllers and [other devices](https://github.com/ublue-os/config) included out of the box
  - All multimedia codecs included
  - System designed for automatic staging of updates
    - If you've never used an image-based Linux before just use your computer normally
    - Don't overthink it, just shut your computer off when you're not using it

### Applications

- Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, DejaDup, FontDownloader, Flatseal, and the Haruna Media Player.
- Core KDE Applications installed:
  - Kcalc, kalendar, Okular, Dolphin File Manger, Kate, kWeather, Filelight, and KDE Partition Manager.

## How is this different from Fedora Kinoite?

Other than the visual differences, and codecs, there are some other key differences between Bluefin and Fedora Kinoite from a usage perspective:

- Aurora takes a [greenfield approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project) to Linux applications by defaulting to Flathub and `brew` by default
- Aurora doesn't recommend using Toolbx - it instead focuses on [devcontainers](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=39) for declarative containerized development. You can use Podman or Docker to run and bootstrap your containers.
- Aurora *tries* to remove the need for the user to use `rpm-ostree` or `bootc` directly
- Aurora focuses on automation of OS services and upgrades instead of user interaction. Upgrades are automatic and silent, so you never have to think about it again. 

## Starship is not for me, how do I disable it?

You can remove or comment the line below in `/etc/bashrc` to restore the default prompt.

```bash
eval "$(starship init bash)"
```
