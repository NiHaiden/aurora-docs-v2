description: Useful references for Aurora outside of the official documentation.
---

- [Bluefin Documentation](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/): Relevant information for Aurora outside of the GNOME specific tweaks and update channels.
- [Bazzite Documentation](https://docs.bazzite.gg): Some information will not apply to Aurora, but some of it may be useful to reference for topics you are unsure about.
- [Fedora Kinoite Documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-kinoite/): Aurora would not exist without Fedora Kinoite, so it's best to reference technical information here.
